The entire staff we worked with was polite, professional, upbeat and I wouldn’t doubt my decision to use them for one second. Not to mention the food was delicious, we constantly received compliments on the food and how much people loved it. If I ever need a caterer in the future, I know who i’ll be using.

I also ordered lasagnas from Indy Fresh for a Celebration of Life dinner at our church and for a meal at Christmas time at my house. I kept the lasagnas in the fridge until 30 minutes before mealtime. They were easy to heat up, serve and were simply delicious!"</p>
